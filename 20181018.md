# Day 002: Getting started with React

## What
I started with the Further Reading from 20171016.md:

### ES6 Classes  
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes

This is not a true classical inheritance model but syntactical sugar over JavaScript's prototypal inheritance.

Class expressions and class declarations work the same way as those for functions with one important exception: those for classes are not hoisted so a class expression or declaration needs to precede it being accessed.

Then a bunch of long complicated shiz using math and `Animal`s to pretend to explain it to me. I've never used any of these things anyway.

### Template Literals  
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals

New name for template strings.

### Let  
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let

`let` allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. This is unlike the `var` keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.

### Const  
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const

Constants are block-scoped, much like variables defined using the let statement. The value of a constant cannot change through re-assignment, and it can't be redeclared.

This declaration creates a constant whose scope can be either global or local to the block in which it is declared. Global constants do not become properties of the window object, unlike var variables. An initializer for a constant is required; that is, you must specify its value in the same statement in which it's declared (which makes sense, given that it can't be changed later).

The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. It does not mean the value it holds is immutable, just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned. For instance, in the case where the content is an object, this means the object's contents (e.g., its parameters) can be altered.
