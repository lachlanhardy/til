## Warnings
`:set -fwarn-incomplete-patterns`

`:set -Wall`

## Code repetition

Prefer  
`q@(Full{}) <+> _ = q` 
to  
`Full a <+> _ = Full a`


## foldLeft
```
foldLeft :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> List a -> b
foldleft     f               z    list

var r = z;
foreach (el in list) {
	r = f(r, el);
}
return r;

So basically foldLeft is a loop:
product = foldLeft (*) 1
```
