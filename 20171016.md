# Getting started with React.

## What
I went to https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html to follow the tutorial.

Skimmed through https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript looking for ES6 stuff I might not know. Turns out I remember most of that, but it didn't have the ES6 goodies I was looking for.

Then spent time with Arrow Functions and Rest Parameters

### Arrow Functions https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions

I hadn't realised arrow functions doesn't bind `this`. Instead it preserves the `this` value of the enclosing execution context. That's delicious and far more important than the syntactical sugar (which I already like). Why has nobody ever mentioned this?

#### Function Body
```
var func = x => x * x;
// concise syntax, implied "return"

var func = (x, y) => { return x + y; };
// with block body, explicit "return" needed
```

#### Parsing order
```
let callback;

callback = callback || function() {};
// ok

callback = callback || () => {};
// SyntaxError: invalid arrow-function arguments

callback = callback || (() => {});
// ok
```

This makes sense but seems a pain.

### Rest Parameters
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters

There are three main differences between rest parameters and the arguments object:

1. rest parameters are only the ones that haven't been given a separate name, while the arguments object contains all arguments passed to the function;
2. the arguments object is not a real array, while rest parameters are Array instances, meaning methods like sort, map, forEach or pop can be applied on it directly; and
3. the arguments object has additional functionality specific to itself (like the callee property).
